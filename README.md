I made a console app using WebApi.Client library from Microsoft.
I have only added UpdateInsert method for products/clients/suppliers/relationships which can be done with using its corresponding proccessors AddProduct method.

I primarily used the Microsoft.WebAPi.Client library for the Api, which was the hardest part.
I used the System.Text.Json library to convert my C# Model classes into json.

It was as simple as that. I didn't do much of anything else.
